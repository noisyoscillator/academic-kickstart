In practitioner's terms a 'derivative security' is a security whose value depends on the values of other more basic underlying securities; cf. Hull ( 1999), p.l.
We adopt a more precise academic definition, in the spirit of Ingersoll ( 1986):
> A derivative security, or contingent claim, is a financial contract whose value at expiration date $T$ (more brieï¬‚y, expiry) is determined
exactly by the price {or prices within a prespecifed time-interval} of the underlying financial assets (or instruments) at time $T$ (within the time interval
$$[0,T]$$).
