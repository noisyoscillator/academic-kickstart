# Biography

Pinaki Bhattacharyya has done Doctoral Research in field of Theoretical Biophysics and Stochastic Processes with a number of publications in internationally peer reviewed journals. With exceptional mathematical skills and proficiency with computer programs I have cultivated keen interest in the broad area of Quantitative Finance with Python as tool for programming and data analysis. My current focus lies in Stochastic volatility and Interest rate models, developing and analyzing new financial instruments and derivative products for emerging markets, portfolio risk management, time series analysis and forecasting.
